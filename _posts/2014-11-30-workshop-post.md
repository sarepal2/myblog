This workshop will provide an introduction to using the version control system Git from the command line. Attendees will learn the basics of creating a new Git repository, committing changes and pushing their work to GitHub, a free website for hosting code. For an example project, we will learn how to create a personal website using Jekyll. Attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own computers but laptops will be on hand for those who need them.
